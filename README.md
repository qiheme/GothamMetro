##Overview

**Gotham Metro** is a public transportation navigation application for planning a commute within the New York City Metro area. The idea of the application was to incorporate real-time data and commute adjustment in order to route a user efficiently to their intended destination. This app was a sample Rails project for the January 2014 Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly. It was developed over a 3 day sprint to model the agile software development process.

##Technologies Used

* Ruby 2.1.0
* Ruby on Rails
* PostgreSQL Database
* Authentication & Authorization from scratch using bcrypt-ruby
* Global Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) gem and data supplied by PATH in GTFS format

##User Stories Completed

* As a user I should be able to check the PATH train schedule to determine which train I should take
* As a user I should be able to Log In so I can check the schedules

##Backlog
